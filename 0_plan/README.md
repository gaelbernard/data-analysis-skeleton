# Stage 0: Plan

Define your project before writing any code. This happens in two phases.

## Phase 1: Brainstorm

Open a conversation with the LLM (in ask mode) and describe your project idea. You can:

- Have multiple conversations — no need to capture everything in one session
- Explore different angles, challenge assumptions, refine your thinking
- The LLM will ask clarifying questions and suggest approaches

Don't worry about filling in `plan.md` yet. Just think.

## Phase 2: Consolidate

When you're ready, tell the LLM: "let's finalize the plan." It will:

1. Summarize what it understands about the project
2. Ask you to confirm the overall direction
3. Go through `plan.md` section by section, asking for any missing details
4. Fill in `plan.md` with the agreed plan

## Files

- `plan.md` — The project plan (fill this in during Phase 2)
- `decisions.md` — Decision log (update throughout the project, not just here)

## When is Stage 0 done?

When every section of `plan.md` has real content (no more italic placeholder prompts) and you feel confident about the direction. Then move to `1_data/`.
