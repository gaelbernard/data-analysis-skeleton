# Stage 0: Plan

Brainstorm with the LLM (in ask mode) to define the project before writing any code.

## What to do

1. Open a conversation and describe your project idea
2. Discuss: objectives, data sources, transformations, output format, audience
3. Fill in `plan.md` with the agreed plan
4. Log key decisions in `decisions.md` as the project evolves

## Files

- `plan.md` — The project plan (fill this in during brainstorming)
- `decisions.md` — Decision log (update throughout the project)
